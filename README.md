# DDH_code_repository
This repository shares the code for performing cluster analysis and machine learing algorithms intended to identify subtypes within the Crowe I DDH cases.
For each analysis, please read the instructions along the code to reproduce this analysis.


## raw data ##
Raw data contains data for each case that was inlcuded in the cluster analysis and in the development of machine learning algorithms. Note that the average of four measurements was shown in raw data.
